      &quot;I began supervising Martha during her licensing process. I have been a clinical 
      supervisor for 2 decades, and Martha stood out immediately as a gifted therapist. 
      I could see rigtht away that she brought a brilliance, skillfulness, and clarity to
      her clinical work that often takes decades to achieve.  Along with this giftedness, 
      Martha brings authenticity and warmth to her clinical work—connecting easily with clients. 
      Great therapists stay growing their skills and self-knowledge to support their clients 
      more effectively—and this is a big part of who Martha is as a person and therapist. 
      For a clients who wants a  journey of healing, growth, and expansion, they would be 
      deeply benefited by working with Martha.&quot;<br/><br/> - Ruby Jo Walker, LCSW, SEP, CHT
